encoding: combined by alphabet?
If it is encoded by combining alphabet, then the lenght of a Chinese Words is not sure, and may be longer than that in utf-8.
For example, 二 is coded as "rv", and 四 is coded as "slghv".
Each alphabet is coded as 8 bits, and 四 is 40 bits.
To identify a complete works, each work should have both start and end string.
There is many langues in world, and each needs a indentifier.
So we can combine the start string and indentifier as a word starter.
Because each word has a starter, the file will be large.
In a file, set the main language coding in the head.
If there is another coding in the file, add a special starter and ender for the words which may be continuous.
